To prove the identity \(\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1\), we can use the unit circle definition of sine and cosine:

1. **Unit Circle Approach**:
   - On the unit circle (radius \( r = 1 \)), any point is represented as \( (\cos\theta, \sin\theta) \).
   - The distance from this point to the origin is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: 
     \[
     (\cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2 = 1^2
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1
     \]

2. **Euler's Formula**:
   - Using Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \).
   - Taking the magnitude of both sides:
     \[
     |e^{i\theta}| = |\cos\theta + i\sin\theta| = 1
     \]
   - The magnitude is:
     \[
     \sqrt{(\cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2} = 1
     \]
   - Squaring both sides gives the identity.

Both methods confirm that \( \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1 \).
