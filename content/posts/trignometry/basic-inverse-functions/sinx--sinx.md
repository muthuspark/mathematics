Let's explore the concept step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Inverse Sine Function

The notation \(\sin^{-1}(x)\) represents the **inverse sine function**, which is often referred to as \(\arcsin(x)\). This function returns an angle whose sine value is \(x\).

Mathematically:

\[
\sin^{-1}(x) = y \quad \text{if and only if} \quad \sin(y) = x
\]
where the range of \(y\) is restricted to \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\).

### Step 2: Applying the Inverse Sine Function Twice

Let's consider applying \(\sin^{-1}(x)\) twice:

\[
\sin^{-1}\left( \sin^{-1}(x) \right)
\]

From the definition of the inverse sine function, we know that if \(y = \sin^{-1}(x)\), then:

\[
\sin(y) = x
\]
and since \(y\) is within \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), applying \(\sin^{-1}\) again should return the original angle.

### Step 3: Proving \(\sin^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}(x)\)

The equation \(\sin^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}(x)\) might seem trivial at first glance. However, it highlights a key property of inverse functions:

- **Inverse Function Property**: If \(f\) is an invertible function with domain \(D\) and range \(R\), then for every \(y\) in \(R\):
  \[
  f^{-1}(f(y)) = y
  \]
  
Applying this to the sine function:
- The sine function, \(\sin(y)\), maps real numbers to values between \(-1\) and \(1\).
- The inverse sine function, \(\sin^{-1}(y)\), maps these values back to angles in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Thus:

\[
\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x
\]
for all \(x\) within the domain of \(\sin^{-1}(x)\), which is \([-1, 1]\).

### Step 4: Conclusion

The equation \(\sin^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}(x)\) effectively demonstrates that applying the inverse sine function to its output yields the original input, which is a fundamental property of inverse functions.

\[
\boxed{\sin^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}(x)}
\]
