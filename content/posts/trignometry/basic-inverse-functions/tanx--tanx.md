**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

Let's consider the expression \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), which represents the inverse tangent function. We aim to prove that:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)
\]

**Step 1: Understanding Inverse Functions**

The notation \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) denotes the inverse tangent function, also known as arctangent. Specifically, if we have a value \(y\) such that:

\[
y = \tan(y')
\]

then:

\[
y' = \tan^{-1}(y)
\]

This means that applying the tangent function to its inverse yields the original input.

**Step 2: Substituting the Definition**

Let’s denote:

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)
\]

By definition of the inverse tangent, this implies:

\[
\tan(\theta) = x
\]

**Step 3: Applying Tangent to Both Sides**

Substitute \(\theta\) back into the original expression. Taking the tangent of both sides:

\[
\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \tan(\theta)
\]

From Step 2, we know that \(\tan(\theta) = x\). Therefore:

\[
\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x
\]

**Step 4: Simplifying the Left Side**

The left side of the equation simplifies using the property of inverse functions. Specifically:

\[
\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x
\]

This means that applying the tangent function to its own inverse simply returns the original input \(x\).

**Step 5: Conclusion**

From Step 3 and Step 4, we have shown that both sides of the equation \(\tan^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)\) simplify to \(x\). Therefore:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)
\]

This completes the proof.

**Final Statement:**

By substituting and simplifying, we’ve proven that the inverse tangent of any real number \(x\) is equal to itself. This fundamental property underpins many trigonometric identities and simplifications in calculus and other mathematical fields.
