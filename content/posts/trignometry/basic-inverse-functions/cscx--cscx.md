To address the statement "csc⁻¹(x) = csc⁻¹(x)", let's explore it step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the Definition of Inverse Cosecant**

The inverse cosecant function, denoted as \( \csc^{-1}(x) \), is the inverse of the cosecant function. This means that for a given value \( x \), \( \csc^{-1}(x) \) returns an angle whose cosecant is \( x \).

**Step 2: Domain and Range of Inverse Cosecant**

The domain of \( \csc(\theta) \) is all real numbers except where \( \sin(\theta) = 0 \), because division by zero is undefined. The range of \( \csc^{-1}(x) \) is typically defined as \( [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] \) excluding 0, to ensure the function is one-to-one and invertible.

**Step 3: Evaluating \( \csc^{-1}(x) \)**

When you apply \( \csc^{-1}(x) \), it gives an angle \( \theta \) such that:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}
\]
and \( \theta \) lies within the range \( [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] \).

**Step 4: Comparing Both Sides of the Equation**

The equation presented is:

\[
\csc^{-1}(x) = \csc^{-1}(x)
\]
This statement asserts that applying \( \csc^{-1} \) to \( x \) yields the same result as itself.

**Step 5: Analyzing the Equality**

At first glance, this equality appears trivial because both sides are identical. However, for an equality involving functions, it must hold true within the specified domain and range of the function.

In this case, since \( \csc^{-1}(x) \) is a well-defined inverse function with its own range, applying it twice on \( x \) should yield:

\[
\csc^{-1}(\csc^{-1}(x)) = x
\]
This equality holds true within the domain of \( \csc^{-1} \), which excludes values where \( \sin(\theta) = 0 \).

**Step 6: Conclusion**

While the original statement "csc⁻¹(x) = csc⁻¹(x)" seems to be asserting an identity, it's important to recognize that this is a general property of inverse functions. Specifically, for any valid input within the function's domain, applying the function twice will yield the original value.

Therefore:

\[
\boxed{ \csc^{-1}(x) = x }
\]
This holds true if \( x \) lies within the range of \( \csc^{-1} \), which is \( [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] \) excluding 0.
