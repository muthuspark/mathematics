Here's a clear step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understand Definitions**: Both `cos⁻¹(x)` and `arccosine(x)` refer to the inverse cosine function, denoted as arccosine.

2. **Domain and Range**:
   - The domain of arccosine is [-1, 1].
   - Its range is [0, π], ensuring each input maps to a unique angle in this interval.

3. **Function Property**: Arccosine is the inverse function of cosine on its domain. Therefore, applying arccosine to an x within [-1, 1] yields the angle whose cosine is x.

4. **Equality of Expressions**:
   - `cos⁻¹(x)` and `arccosine(x)` are identical notations.
   - Both evaluate to the unique angle θ in [0, π] such that cos(θ) = x.

5. **Conclusion**: Since both expressions map x to the same θ, they are equal for all valid inputs within their domain.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\cos^{-1}(x) = \arccos(x)}
\]
