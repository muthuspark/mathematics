To determine the exact value of \( \tan^{-1}(2) + \tan^{-1}(3) \), we can use trigonometric identities. 

First, recall that for two angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) with tangent values 2 and 3 respectively, the sum formula is:

\[
\tan(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = \frac{\tan \theta_1 + \tan \theta_2}{1 - \tan \theta_1 \tan \theta_2}
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\tan(\tan^{-1}(2) + \tan^{-1}(3)) = \frac{2 + 3}{1 - (2 \cdot 3)} = \frac{5}{1 - 6} = \frac{5}{-5} = -1
\]

The tangent of the sum is -1, which corresponds to an angle whose tangent is -1. Since both \( \tan^{-1}(2) \) and \( \tan^{-1}(3) \) are in the first quadrant (between 0 and \( \frac{\pi}{2} \)), their sum must be between 0 and \( \pi \). The principal value where tangent is -1 is \( \frac{3\pi}{4} \).

Thus, the exact value of \( \tan^{-1}(2) + \tan^{-1}(3) \) is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3\pi}{4}}
\]
