Let's provide a clear and step-by-step proof for the identity \( \csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta) \).

**Step 1: Recall the Definition of Cosecant**

The cosecant function is defined as the reciprocal of the sine function:

\[ \csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} \]

**Step 2: Understand the Property of Sine for Negative Angles**

One key property of trigonometric functions, particularly the sine function, is that it is an **odd function**. This means that:

\[ \sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta) \]
In other words, when you input a negative angle into the sine function, it outputs the negative of what it would have outputted for the positive angle.

**Step 3: Apply the Sine Function to Negative Angle**

Using the property from Step 2:

\[ \csc(-\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(-\theta)} = \frac{1}{-\sin(\theta)} \]

**Step 4: Simplify the Expression**

Simplify the denominator by factoring out a negative sign:

\[ \csc(-\theta) = \frac{-1}{\sin(\theta)} \]

**Step 5: Express as Negative Cosecant Function**

Recognize that \( -\frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} \) is equivalent to \( -\csc(\theta) \):

\[ \csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta) \]

**Conclusion**

By using the definition of cosecant and the property of sine being an odd function, we have shown that:

\[ \boxed{\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)} \]
