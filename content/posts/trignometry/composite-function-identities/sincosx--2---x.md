To determine when the equation \(\sin^{-1}(\cos x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - x\) holds true, we need to consider the domains and ranges of both functions involved.

1. **Understanding the Functions**:
   - The function \(\cos x\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\) and oscillates between -1 and 1.
   - The inverse sine function, \(\sin^{-1}(y)\), has a range of \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For the identity to hold, the argument inside the inverse sine function must be within its domain.
   - The expression \(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\) must also lie within the range of \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

3. **Domain Analysis**:
   - The expression \(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\) falls outside the principal value range \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) when \(x\) is not within [0, π].
   - For \(0 \leq x \leq \pi\), both sides of the equation are within the appropriate domains.

4. **Verification**:
   - When \(x = 0\), \(\sin^{-1}(\cos 0) = \sin^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{2}\).
   - When \(x = \pi\), \(\sin^{-1}(\cos \pi) = \sin^{-1}(-1) = -\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Thus, the equation \(\sin^{-1}(\cos x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - x\) holds true for \(0 \leq x \leq \pi\). The solution is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{\pi}{2} - x}
\]
