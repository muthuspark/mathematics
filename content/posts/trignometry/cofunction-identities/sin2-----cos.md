**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof**

We aim to prove that:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)
\]

**1. Understanding Radians and Degrees:**
   - Recall that \( \pi \) radians is equivalent to 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians equals 90 degrees.

**2. Rewriting the Equation Using Degrees:**
   - Substitute \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) with 90° in the original equation:
     \[
     \sin\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)
     \]

**3. Applying the Co-function Identity:**
   - The **co-function identity** states that for any angle \( A \):
     \[
     \sin(A) = \cos\left(90^\circ - A\right)
     \]
   - Let’s set \( A = 90^\circ - \theta \). Substituting into the co-function identity:
     \[
     \sin\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \cos\left(90^\circ - (90^\circ - \theta)\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying inside the cosine function:
     \[
     \sin\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)
     \]

**4. Conclusion:**
   - Thus, we have proven that:
     \[
     \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)
     \]
   
This identity is a direct consequence of the co-function relationship in trigonometry, linking sine and cosine functions through complementary angles.
