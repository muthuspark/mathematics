To prove that \(\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sec\theta\), we can proceed step by step as follows:

**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**

- **Cosecant (csc)** is defined as the reciprocal of sine:
  
  \[
  \csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}
  \]
  
- **Secant (sec)** is defined as the reciprocal of cosine:
  
  \[
  \sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}
  \]

**Step 2: Apply the Cosecant Function to the Angle**

We start with:

\[
\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)
\]

Using the definition of cosecant, this becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)}
\]

**Step 3: Use the Co-Function Identity for Sine**

Recall that:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos\theta
\]

Substituting this into our expression:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos\theta}
\]

**Step 4: Relate to Secant**

From the definition of secant, we have:

\[
\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos\theta} = \sec\theta
\]

**Conclusion**

Combining all the steps, we conclude that:

\[
\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sec\theta
\]

This identity holds true by utilizing the co-function relationships between sine and cosine.
