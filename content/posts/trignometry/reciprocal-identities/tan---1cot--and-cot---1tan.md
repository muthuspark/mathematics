**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

*Let’s explore why \(\tan{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cot{\theta}}\) for an angle \(\theta\).*

To establish that \(\tan{\theta}\) is the reciprocal of \(\cot{\theta}\), we can use their definitions in terms of sine and cosine.

1. **Definitions:**
   - The tangent of an angle \(\theta\) (written as \(\tan{\theta}\)) is defined as:
     \[
     \tan{\theta} = \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}
     \]
   - The cotangent of an angle \(\theta\) (written as \(\cot{\theta}\)) is the reciprocal of tangent, and it can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine:
     \[
     \cot{\theta} = \frac{1}{\tan{\theta}} = \frac{\cos{\theta}}{\sin{\theta}}
     \]

2. **Expressing \(\tan{\theta}\) as a Reciprocal:**
   - To show that \(\tan{\theta}\) is the reciprocal of \(\cot{\theta}\), observe the following:
     \[
     \tan{\theta} = \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}
     \]
     and
     \[
     \cot{\theta} = \frac{\cos{\theta}}{\sin{\theta}}
     \]
   - Notice that if you take the reciprocal of \(\cot{\theta}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{\cot{\theta}} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\cos{\theta}}{\sin{\theta}} \right)} = \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}
     \]
   - This simplifies exactly to the definition of \(\tan{\theta}\):
     \[
     \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}} = \tan{\theta}
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, we have shown that:
     \[
     \tan{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cot{\theta}}
     \]
   - This reciprocal relationship holds true for any angle \(\theta\) where both sine and cosine are defined (i.e., where \(\cos{\theta} \neq 0\)).

**Summary:**

- Starting from the definitions of tangent and cotangent in terms of sine and cosine,
- We observe that taking the reciprocal of cotangent directly yields tangent,
- This confirms the relationship \(\tan{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cot{\theta}}\).

This proof relies on understanding the fundamental relationships between trigonometric functions, specifically how tangent is the reciprocal of cotangent.
