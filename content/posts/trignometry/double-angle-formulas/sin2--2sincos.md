 Let's provide a step-by-step proof for the identity \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\).

**Step 1: Recall the Angle Addition Formula**

The sine of the sum of two angles can be expressed using the following formula:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]

This formula allows us to expand the sine of a sum into simpler terms involving sines and cosines of individual angles.

---

**Step 2: Apply the Formula to \( \sin(2\theta) \)**

Notice that \( 2\theta = \theta + \theta \). Therefore, we can apply the angle addition formula by setting both angles \( A \) and \( B \) equal to \( \theta \):

\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin \theta \cos \theta + \cos \theta \sin \theta
\]

---

**Step 3: Simplify the Expression**

Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \sin \theta \cos \theta + \cos \theta \sin \theta
\]

Combine like terms (\(\sin \theta \cos \theta\) and \(\cos \theta \sin \theta\) are identical):

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta
\]

---

**Conclusion**

Thus, we have proven that:

\[
\boxed{\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}
\]
