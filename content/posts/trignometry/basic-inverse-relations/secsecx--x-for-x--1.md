To write a detailed explanation about how reciprocals work with trigonometric functions, we need to consider the relationships between sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, and their reciprocal counterparts. Here are the key steps:

1. **Reciprocal Relationships**: The secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function: 
   \[
   \sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}
   \]
   
2. **Using Inverse Trigonometric Functions**: When an angle is defined via its inverse trigonometric function (e.g., \( \arccos \)), we can express the secant or tangent of that angle in terms of the given value.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose we have an angle \( y = \arctan(x) \). Then, \( \tan(y) = x \).
   - We draw a right triangle where the opposite side is \( x \) and the adjacent side is 1.
   - The hypotenuse of this triangle is \( \sqrt{1 + x^2} \).
   - Therefore, \( \sec(y) = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}} = \sqrt{1 + x^2} \).

Thus, the reciprocal relationship between secant and cosine allows expressions like:

\[
\boxed{\sec(\arccos(x)) = \sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]
