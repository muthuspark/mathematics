To determine if \(\cot(\cot^{-1}(x))\) is equal to \(x\) for any real number \(x\), we need to understand the relationship between the arccotangent function and its inverse. 

The arccotangent function, denoted as \(\cot^{-1}(x)\), maps a real number \(x\) to an angle \(y\) in the interval \((0, \pi)\) such that \(\cot(y) = x\). This means that for any real number \(x\), there exists an angle \(y\) in \((0, \pi)\) where \(\cot(y) = x\).

When we apply the cotangent function to this angle \(y\), we get:

\[
\cot(y) = x
\]
Thus, \(\cot(\cot^{-1}(x)) = x\). This holds true regardless of whether \(x\) is positive or negative because \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) always returns an angle in the interval \((0, \pi)\), and the cotangent function will map this angle back to \(x\).

Therefore, the identity \(\cot(\cot^{-1}(x)) = x\) holds for any real number \(x\).

\[
\boxed{x}
\]
