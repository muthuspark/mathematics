**Expansion Shortcuts in Binomial Theorem: A Step-by-Step Guide**

**Introduction:**
When dealing with expressions like \((a + b)^n\), expanding them manually for large \(n\) can be time-consuming. Instead, we can use **binomial expansion shortcuts** to simplify the process.

**General Term Formula:**
Each term in the expansion is given by:
\[ T_{k+1} = C(n, k) \cdot a^{n - k} \cdot b^k \]
where \(C(n, k)\) is the binomial coefficient calculated using:
\[ C(n, k) = \frac{(n - k + 1)(n - k + 2) \cdots (n - k)}{k!} \]

**Steps to Use the General Term Formula:**

1. **Identify the term number \(k\):**
   Determine which power of \(b\) you want in the expansion.

2. **Compute the binomial coefficient \(C(n, k)\) using the multiplicative approach:**
   Multiply from \((n - k + 1)\) down to 1 and divide by \(k!\). This avoids computing factorials directly, making it more efficient for large \(n\).

3. **Calculate each term using the formula:**
   For each \(k\), plug into the general term formula to find the specific coefficient.

**Example:**

Let's expand \((x + y)^4\) using shortcuts:

1. Identify \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).
2. Compute each term:
   - \(T_1 = C(4, 0) \cdot x^{4-0} \cdot y^0 = 1 \cdot x^4 \cdot 1 = x^4\)
   - \(T_2 = C(4, 1) \cdot x^{3} \cdot y^1 = 4x^3y\)
   - \(T_3 = C(4, 2) \cdot x^{2} \cdot y^2 = 6x^2y^2\)
   - \(T_4 = C(4, 3) \cdot x^{1} \cdot y^3 = 4xy^3\)
   - \(T_5 = C(4, 4) \cdot x^{0} \cdot y^4 = 1y^4\)

**Expansion:**
\[ (x + y)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4 \]

This method efficiently computes each term without manually expanding every combination, making it ideal for larger exponents.
