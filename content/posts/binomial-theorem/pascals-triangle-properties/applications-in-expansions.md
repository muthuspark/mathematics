**Understanding Pascal's Triangle and Binomial Expansions**

Pascal's Triangle is a fundamental tool in algebra, especially when dealing with binomial expansions. Each row in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients found in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\), where \(n\) represents the exponent.

1. **Rows Corresponding to Exponents:**
   - The first row (Row 0) is for \((a + b)^0 = 1\).
   - The second row (Row 1) is for \((a + b)^1 = a + b\).
   - The third row (Row 2) is for \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\), and so on.

2. **Coefficients as Combinations:**
   - Each number in Pascal's Triangle is a combination, denoted as \(C(n, k)\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) without regard to order.
   - For example, in Row 3 (\( (a + b)^3 \)), the coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1, corresponding to \(C(3, 0)\), \(C(3, 1)\), \(C(3, 2)\), and \(C(3, 3)\).

3. **Binomial Expansion Formula:**
   - The expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by:
     \[
     (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot a^{n-k} \cdot b^k
     \]
   - This means each term in the expansion has coefficients from Pascal's Triangle.

4. **Example: Expanding \((2x + 3y)^4\)**
   - The Row 4 of Pascal's Triangle is 1, 4, 6, 4, 1.
   - The expansion using these coefficients:
     \[
     (2x)^4 + 4(2x)^3(3y) + 6(2x)^2(3y)^2 + 4(2x)(3y)^3 + (3y)^4
     \]
   - Calculating each term results in: \(16x^4 + 96x^3y + 216x^2y^2 + 216xy^3 + 81y^4\).

5. **Applications:**
   - Pascal's Triangle is crucial in probability, combinatorics, and algebra.
   - It simplifies binomial expansions by providing the necessary coefficients.

In summary, Pascal's Triangle provides the coefficients for expanding binomials raised to any power, making it an indispensable tool in algebraic expansions.
