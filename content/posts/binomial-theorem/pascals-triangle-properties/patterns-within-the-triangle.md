Pascal's Triangle is a fundamental tool in algebra that reveals numerous patterns useful for understanding binomial expansions. Here are the key patterns and their explanations:

1. **Edge Numbers**: All edge numbers (numbers at the start or end of each row) are ones because they correspond to binomial coefficients when \( n = 0 \).

2. **Binomial Coefficients**: Each number in Pascal's Triangle is a binomial coefficient, specifically \( C(n, k) \), where \( n \) is the row number and \( k \) is the position within that row.

3. **Symmetry**: The triangle has symmetry such that \( C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) \). This means the numbers on either side of the center are equal.

4. **Sum of Rows**: Each row sums to \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is the row number. For example, Row 0: 1; Row 1: 1 + 1 = 2; Row 2: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4; and so on.

5. **Pattern of Every Other Element**: The sum of every other element (starting from the first or second) in a row gives \( 2^{n - 1} \). For example, Row 3: 1 + 3 = 4 = \( 2^2 \).

6. **Combinatorial Problems**: Each number corresponds to combinatorial problems, such as finding the number of ways to choose \( k \) items from \( n \), which is \( C(n, k) \).

7. **Recursive Pattern**: Each row is built by adding adjacent numbers from the previous row: \( C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k - 1) + C(n - 1, k) \).

These patterns help in understanding and using Pascal's Triangle effectively for binomial expansions and combinatorial problems.
