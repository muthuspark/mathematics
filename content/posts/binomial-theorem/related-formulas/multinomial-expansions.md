**Multinomial Expansions in the Binomial Theorem**

In mathematics, the binomial theorem deals with the expansion of expressions raised to a power, typically involving two terms. However, when dealing with more than two terms, we use the multinomial theorem. This theorem generalizes the binomial case and allows us to expand expressions like \((a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k)^n\) into a sum of terms.

### Key Concepts

1. **Multinomial Expansion**: The expansion involves distributing \( n \) identical items (or variables) across \( k \) distinct categories, resulting in terms where the exponents of each variable add up to \( n \).

2. **General Form**: 
   \[
   (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k)^n = \sum_{i_1 + i_2 + \dots + i_k = n} \frac{n!}{i_1! \, i_2! \, \dots \, i_k!} \cdot a_1^{i_1} a_2^{i_2} \dots a_k^{i_k}
   \]
   Here, \( C(n; i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k) = \frac{n!}{i_1! \, i_2! \, \dots \, i_k!} \) is the multinomial coefficient.

3. **Step-by-Step Process**:
   - Identify all combinations of exponents \( (i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k) \) such that their sum equals \( n \).
   - Calculate each term using the formula involving the multinomial coefficient and the variables.
   - Sum all terms to get the complete expansion.

### Examples

- **Example 1**: Expand \((x + y + z)^2\)
  
  Using the multinomial theorem:
  \[
  (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz
  \]
  This shows how each combination of exponents contributes to the final expansion.

- **Example 2**: Expand \((a + b + c + d)^3\)
  
  The expansion will include terms where each variable's exponent ranges from 0 to 3, ensuring their sum is 3. Each term is calculated using the corresponding multinomial coefficient and multiplied by the variables raised to appropriate powers.

### Conclusion

The multinomial theorem provides a systematic method for expanding expressions with multiple variables or terms. By identifying all valid combinations of exponents and calculating each term's coefficient, we can accurately expand such expressions. This approach generalizes beyond the binomial case, making it invaluable in various areas of mathematics and its applications.
