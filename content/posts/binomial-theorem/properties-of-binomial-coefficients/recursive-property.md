**Understanding the Recursive Property of Binomial Coefficients in the Binomial Theorem**

The binomial theorem is a fundamental concept in algebra that expands expressions like (a + b)^n into a sum involving binomial coefficients. These coefficients, denoted as C(n, k), represent the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements and play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics.

One key property of these coefficients is their recursive nature. Each coefficient can be derived from two adjacent coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^n. This relationship allows for an efficient way to compute binomial coefficients, especially when dealing with large exponents.

**Deriving the Recursive Property**

Consider expanding (a + b)^{n+1}. By definition, this is equal to (a + b) multiplied by (a + b)^n:

\[
(a + b)^{n+1} = (a + b)(a + b)^n
\]

When we distribute the terms in the expansion of (a + b)^n over (a + b), each term from (a + b)^n contributes to a new term in (a + b)^{n+1}. Specifically, multiplying by 'a' and then by 'b' gives two separate series:

1. Multiplying by 'a': This shifts the coefficients down by one position.
2. Multiplying by 'b': This adds a zero coefficient at the start of the sequence.

The resulting coefficient for term C(n+1, k) in (a + b)^{n+1} is therefore the sum of two adjacent coefficients from (a + b)^n:

\[
C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k)
\]

**Examples and Illustration**

Let's verify this recursively with a small value. For n=2:

- The expansion is (a + b)^3.
- Using the formula: C(3, 0) = C(2, -1) + C(2, 0). Since C(2, -1)=0, it simplifies to 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.
- For k=1: C(3,1)=C(2,0)+C(2,1)=1+2=3. Correct.
- For k=2: C(3,2)=C(2,1)+C(2,2)=2+1=3. Correct.

This demonstrates the validity of the recursive property in generating binomial coefficients.

**Connection to Pascal's Triangle**

The relationship described above is encapsulated in Pascal's Rule, which states that each entry in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two entries directly above it. This rule underpins the structure of binomial expansions and allows for an efficient computation of coefficients without full expansion.

**Mathematical Proof by Induction**

To ensure the recursive formula holds universally:

- **Base Case:** For n=0, (a + b)^1 = a + b. Coefficients are 1 and 1. Applying C(1,k)=C(0,-1)+C(0,0), which is 0+1=1 for each term.

- **Inductive Step:** Assume the formula holds for n. Then:

\[
(a + b)^{n+1} = (a + b)(a + b)^n
\]

Expanding both terms and applying the inductive hypothesis yields coefficients that satisfy C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k). Thus, by induction, the recursive property is valid for all n.

**Conclusion**

The recursive property of binomial coefficients underpins their role in the Binomial Theorem, enabling efficient computation and highlighting their structural relationship to Pascal's Triangle. This understanding not only simplifies expansions but also reveals deeper mathematical principles, illustrating the interconnectedness of algebraic concepts.
