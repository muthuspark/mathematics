**Symmetry Property of Binomial Coefficients**

In the realm of algebra, particularly within the context of the Binomial Theorem, one of the most fascinating properties is the symmetry inherent in binomial coefficients. This property reveals a beautiful and elegant aspect of combinatorics, where certain terms in an expansion mirror each other.

**Introduction to Binomial Theorem:**
The Binomial Theorem provides a method to expand expressions of the form (a + b)^n. According to this theorem, it can be expressed as:
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot a^{n-k} \cdot b^k
\]
where \(C(n, k)\), or "n choose k," represents the number of ways to select k elements from a set of n elements.

**Understanding Binomial Coefficients:**
The binomial coefficient, denoted as \(C(n, k)\), is calculated using the formula:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
\]
This coefficient quantifies the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n without regard to order.

**Introducing Symmetry:**
The symmetry property arises when examining \(C(n, k)\) and \(C(n, n - k)\). These two coefficients are equal, meaning:
\[
C(n, k) = C(n, n - k)
\]
This implies that the number of ways to choose k elements from n is identical to the number of ways to choose the remaining (n - k) elements. This mirror property is a cornerstone of combinatorial mathematics.

**Proof of Symmetry:**
To demonstrate this equality, substitute \(C(n, k)\) into the formula:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
\]
Similarly, substituting \(C(n, n - k)\):
\[
C(n, n - k) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!k!}
\]
Since both expressions are identical (the numerator and denominator are the same), we conclude that:
\[
C(n, k) = C(n, n - k)
\]

**Examples Illustrating Symmetry:**
1. **Example 1:** Consider \(n = 4\):
   \[
   C(4, 1) = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
   \]
   \[
   C(4, 3) = \frac{4!}{3!(4 - 3)!} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
   \]
   Hence, \(C(4, 1) = C(4, 3)\).

2. **Example 2:** Let \(n = 5\):
   \[
   C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
   \]
   \[
   C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
   \]
   Thus, \(C(5, 2) = C(5, 3)\).

**Implications in the Binomial Theorem:**
This symmetry is crucial for efficiency. When expanding (a + b)^n, computing binomial coefficients for k and n - k yields identical terms, saving computations and enhancing clarity.

**Conclusion:**
The symmetry property of binomial coefficients is a fundamental principle that highlights the elegant and balanced nature of combinatorial mathematics. It not only simplifies algebraic manipulations but also deepens our understanding of combinations and their applications in various fields of study.
