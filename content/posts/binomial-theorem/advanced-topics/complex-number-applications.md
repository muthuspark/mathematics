The generalized binomial theorem extends the binomial expansion beyond non-negative integers, enabling the expansion of expressions with any real or complex exponent. This leads to expansions that include terms with powers of \(i\) (the imaginary unit), such as \(i^k\). These expanded forms are particularly useful in various advanced applications across different fields:

1. **Signal Processing**: Modeling oscillatory behavior and frequency components through complex exponentials.
2. **Physics**: Representing wave functions and other phenomena involving non-integer parameters or periodic components.
3. **Mathematics**: Solving equations with non-linear terms by expanding into series that capture both amplitude and phase changes.
4. **Probability Theory**: Analyzing generating functions for distributions with non-integer parameters, such as those involving oscillations due to complex exponents.

Thus, the binomial theorem's extension allows comprehensive modeling of phenomena requiring oscillatory behavior in various advanced contexts.
