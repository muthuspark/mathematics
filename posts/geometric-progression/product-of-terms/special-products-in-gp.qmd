**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof for the Product of Terms in a Geometric Progression**

**1. Understanding a Geometric Progression (GP):**
A geometric progression is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, denoted as $r$. Mathematically, a GP can be expressed as:
$$a_1, a_1 r, a_1 r^2, a_1 r^3, \ldots, a_1 r^{n-1}$$where$ a_1 $is the first term and$ r \neq 0 $.

**2. Product of k Terms in a GP:**
Consider the product of the first $k$ terms of this GP:
$$P = a_1 \times (a_1 r) \times (a_1 r^2) \times \ldots \times (a_1 r^{k-1})$$

**3. Simplifying the Product:**
Each term in the product is $a_1$ multiplied by successive powers of $r$. When multiplying these terms, we can separate the constants and the variables:
$$P = (a_1)^k \times r^{0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + (k-1)}$$

**4. Summing the Exponents:**
The exponent on $r$ is the sum of the first $k-1$ integers, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
$$\text{Sum} = \frac{(k-1)k}{2}$$

**5. Final Formula:**
Thus, the product $P$ becomes:
$$P = (a_1)^k \times r^{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}$$This formula allows us to find the product of any number$ k $ terms in a GP efficiently.

**6. Example Calculation:**
Let's calculate the product of the first 3 terms of a GP with $a_1 = 2$ and $r = 2$:
$$P = (2)^3 \times (2)^{\frac{3(3-1)}{2}} = 8 \times 2^3 = 8 \times 8 = 64$$This matches the manual calculation:$ 2 \times 4 \times 8 = 64 $.

**7. Generalization and Applications:**
This formula is useful for various applications, such as calculating compound interest over multiple periods or determining growth patterns in biology. It highlights the exponential nature of geometric sequences when their terms are multiplied.

**Conclusion:**
By understanding that each term contributes an additional power of $r$ when multiplied together, we can derive a simple and efficient formula to compute the product of any number of terms in a GP. This demonstrates the powerful interplay between algebraic structures and exponent rules in mathematics.
