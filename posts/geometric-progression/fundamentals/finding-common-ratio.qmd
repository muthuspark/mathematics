**Finding the Common Ratio in a Geometric Progression**

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). The nth term of a GP can be expressed as $a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_1$ is the first term.

**Step-by-Step Guide to Finding the Common Ratio**

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Determine what terms and positions are given in the GP.
   - Note whether consecutive terms or non-consecutive terms are provided.

2. **Use Consecutive Terms for r:**
   - If two consecutive terms are known, such as $a_1$ and $a_2$, calculate r using:
     $$r = \frac{a_2}{a_1}$$
   - This method is straightforward when consecutive terms are available.

3. **Handle Non-Consecutive Terms:**
   - When given non-consecutive terms, such as $a_1$ and $a_k$, use the formula:
     $$r = \left( \frac{a_k}{a_1} \right)^{\frac{1}{k-1}}$$
   - This works if the positions of the terms are known apart by (k-1) intervals.

4. **Consider Negative Common Ratios:**
   - A GP can have a negative common ratio, which flips signs between terms.
   - When taking roots in step 3, both positive and negative solutions should be considered to ensure all possibilities are covered.

5. **Examples and Applications:**
   - For $a_1 = 2$ and $a_3 = 50$, find r:
     $$r^2 = \frac{50}{2} = 25$$$$ r = 5 \text{ or } r = -5$$- For$ a_1 = 2 $and$ a_4 = 24 $, find r:
     $$r^3 = \frac{24}{2} = 12$$$$ r = \sqrt[3]{12}$$

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The common ratio can be determined by evaluating the position and relationship of given terms in a GP.
   - Both positive and negative values are considered, especially when dealing with non-consecutive or equally spaced terms.

By following these steps, you can efficiently find the common ratio in various types of geometric progressions.
