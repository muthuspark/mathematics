**Properties of Geometric Progression Terms**

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant called the common ratio, denoted as $r$. This foundational concept in mathematics is fundamental for understanding sequences and series.

### 1. **Definition and Structure**
- A GP is defined by its first term ($a_1$) and the common ratio ($r$).
- The sequence can be represented as: $a_1, a_2 = a_1 \cdot r, a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = a_1 \cdot r^2, \ldots$
- Each term is generated by multiplying the previous term by $r$.

### 2. **nth Term Formula**
- The nth term of a GP can be expressed as: 
  $$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)}$$**Example:** If$ a_1 = 2 $and$ r = 3 $, then the sequence is $2, 6, 18, \ldots$.

### 3. **Behavior Based on Common Ratio**
- **Positive Common Ratio ($|r| > 0$):**
  - If $r > 1$: Terms increase in magnitude.
  - If $0 < r < 1$: Terms decrease towards zero.
  - If $r = 1$: All terms are equal to $a_1$.

- **Negative Common Ratio ($|r| > 0$ and negative sign):**
  - Depending on the power of $r$, signs alternate between positive and negative.

**Example:** Starting with $a_1 = 5$ and $r = -2$:
- Terms: $5, -10, 20, -40, \ldots$
- Signs alternate due to the negative common ratio.

### 4. **Signs of Terms**
- **All Terms Have Same Sign:**
  - If both $a_1$ and $r$ are positive or negative.
  
- **Alternating Signs When $r$ Changes Sign:**
  - For example, if $a_1 = 3$ and $r = -2$:
    - Terms: $3, -6, 12, -24, \ldots$
    - Signs alternate between positive and negative.

**Example:** Starting with $a_1 = -5$ and $r = 0.5$:
- Terms: $-5, -2.5, -1.25, \ldots$

### 5. **Sum of a GP Series**
- The sum of the first $n$ terms of a GP is given by:
  $$S_n = a_1 \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \quad (r \neq 1)$$- If$ |r| < 1 $, the sum converges to:
  $$S = a_1 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - r}$$**Example:** For$ a_1 = 2 $, $r = 0.5$:
- Sum of first 3 terms: $2 + 1 + 0.5 = 3.5$
- Infinite sum: $S = 4$

### Conclusion
Understanding the properties of geometric progression terms is crucial for analyzing sequences and series in mathematics. The key aspects include the nth term formula, behavior based on the common ratio, signs of terms, and summation. These concepts provide a solid foundation for more advanced studies in mathematics and related fields.

By exploring these properties with examples, one can gain a comprehensive grasp of geometric progressions and their applications.
