**Understanding Geometric Progressions: A Detailed Guide**

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, denoted as 'r'. The general form of a GP is: 

a, ar, ar², ar³, ..., ar^(n-1), ...

Here's a step-by-step guide to finding the nth term using the formula an = ar^(n-1):

### Define the Terms

- **First Term (a):** The initial value of the sequence.
- **Common Ratio (r):** The constant multiplier between consecutive terms.

### Observe the Pattern

Let's write out the first few terms to identify the pattern:

1. Term 1: a
2. Term 2: ar
3. Term 3: ar²
4. Term 4: ar³
5. ...

Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 'r'.

### Derive the Formula

To find the nth term, we can express it in terms of the first term and the ratio:

an = a * r^(n-1)

**Explanation:**
- When n=1 (first term), an = a * r^(0) = a*1 = a.
- For each subsequent n, you multiply by 'r' one more time than the previous exponent.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

Given a GP where the first term is 2 and common ratio is 3:

- Term 1 (n=1): a * r^(0) = 2*1 = 2
- Term 2 (n=2): 2*3¹ = 6
- Term 3 (n=3): 2*3² = 18
- ...

**Example 2:**

For a GP with first term 5 and common ratio -2:

- Term 1 (n=1): 5*(-2)⁰ = 5
- Term 2 (n=2): 5*(-2)^1 = -10
- Term 3 (n=3): 5*(-2)² = 20

### Special Cases

- **When r = 1:** All terms are equal to the first term 'a'.
- **When r = 0:** After the first term, all subsequent terms are zero.

### Applications

Understanding this formula is crucial for various applications, including financial calculations and growth patterns. It allows you to find any term in the sequence efficiently without listing all preceding terms.

By following these steps, you can confidently use the formula an = ar^(n-1) to determine any term in a geometric progression.
