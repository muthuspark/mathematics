1. **Geometric Progression (GP):** A sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous one by a constant called the common ratio $r$.

2. **Geometric Mean:** The central tendency of numbers, calculated as the nth root of the product of n numbers.

3. **Relation in GP:**
   - For four terms $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3$, their geometric mean is $a\sqrt{r^3}$.
   - Given specific geometric means for certain pairs, set up equations to solve for both the initial term $a$ and common ratio $r$.

4. **Example:** If geometric mean of first two terms is 8 and between third and fourth is 64:
   - $a\sqrt{r^3} = 8$
   - $ar^{5/2} = 64$
   
   Solving these equations gives the common ratio and initial term. 

**Answer:** The geometric mean relates term values in GP by expressing each term as $a r^{n-1}$, allowing calculation through common ratio and given conditions.
