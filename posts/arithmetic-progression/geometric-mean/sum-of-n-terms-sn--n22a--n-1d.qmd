After carefully considering each step and recognizing the constraints of the problem without additional information, here's a summary of the thought process:

1. **Identify the nature of the sequence**: The given terms form an arithmetic progression (AP) with a constant difference.

2. **Recall the formula for the sum of an AP**:
   $$S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d]$$where$ a $is the first term,$ d $is the common difference, and$ n $ is the number of terms.

3. **Express other quantities in terms of known variables**: If specific values for $S_n$, $a$, or $d$ are provided, substitute them into the formula to solve for unknowns.

4. **Consider geometric mean (GM)**:
   - The GM of n numbers is given by:
     $$\text{GM} = \sqrt[n]{a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n}$$- However, without specific values or relationships between the terms, it's difficult to directly relate$ S_n $ and GM.

5. **Explore relationships involving AM (Arithmetic Mean)**:
   - The AM of n numbers is:
     $$\text{AM} = \frac{S_n}{n}$$- While the GM is related through inequalities ($ GM â‰¤ AM$), with equality only when all terms are equal.

6. **Attempting to connect $S_n$ with GM**:
   - If all terms are equal, then $S_n = n \cdot a$ and GM = $a$. So in this case, $S_n = n \cdot \text{GM}$.
   - However, if the sequence is neither constant nor follows other specific rules, connecting $S_n$ and GM isn't straightforward.

7. **Conclusion**: Without specific information about the sequence's first term $a$, common difference $d$, sum $S_n$, number of terms $n$, product, or geometric mean, it's challenging to directly compute how $S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a + (n - 1)d]$ relates to GM. The relationship depends on the specific values and context provided.

**Final Answer**
Without specific information about the sequence, it is not possible to directly connect the sum of terms $S_n$ with the geometric mean (GM). However, if all terms are equal, then $S_n = n \cdot a$ and GM = $a$, showing that $S_n = n \cdot \text{GM}$.

\boxed{S_n = n \times \text{GM}}
