The relationship between arithmetic and geometric means within an arithmetic progression (AP) is explored below:

1. **Arithmetic Progression Basics**: An AP is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. For three terms $a$, $b$, $c$in an AP, they satisfy$2b = a + c$.

2. **Geometric Progression Condition**: Three terms are in geometric progression (GP) if $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{c}{b}$, implying $b^2 = ac$.

3. **Combining Conditions**: If three terms of an AP also form a GP, substituting the GP condition into the AP condition gives:
   $$2ar = a + ar^2$$Simplifying leads to$ (r - 1)^2 = 0 $, so $r = 1$. This implies all terms are equal.

4. **Conclusion**: The only way for an AP and GP of three distinct terms is if they are constant, i.e., every term equals the others. Thus, any geometric mean derived from such a sequence must be trivially equal to each term itself.

**Final Relationship**: In sequences where terms satisfy both arithmetic and geometric progression properties, all terms must be equal. Hence, their geometric means are inherently themselves.
