The formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ represents the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic progression (AP). This is because each term averages out to $\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}$, and multiplying by $n$ gives the total sum. Geometric mean, however, does not directly relate here unless considering multiple terms in a geometric sequence (GP).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Arithmetic Progression Basics:**
   - An AP is a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference.
   - The $k$-th term of an AP is given by $a_k = a_1 + (k - 1)d$, where $d$ is the common difference.

2. **Sum of Terms:**
   - The sum of the first $n$ terms, $S_n$, can be expressed as:
     $$S_n = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) + \dots + [a_1 + (n-1)d]$$- This is an arithmetic series where the average of the first and last term$ (a_1 + a_n)/2 $multiplied by the number of terms$ n $gives the total sum:$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$$

3. **Geometric Mean Context:**
   - While geometric mean is different from arithmetic mean, it's not directly involved in calculating the sum of an AP.
   - However, if multiple terms were considered in a geometric progression (GP), their product would relate to the nth term, but this doesn't translate into the sum formula for an AP.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ is foundational to understanding arithmetic series.
   - Geometric mean is distinct and not directly related unless dealing with multiple terms in a GP, which doesn't affect the sum of an AP.

This explanation highlights how the given formula is derived from the properties of arithmetic progressions and notes that geometric mean isn't relevant here.
