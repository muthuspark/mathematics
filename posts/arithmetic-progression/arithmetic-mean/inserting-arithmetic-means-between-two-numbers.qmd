**Inserting Arithmetic Means Between Two Numbers**

To insert arithmetic means between two numbers $a$ and $b$, we construct an arithmetic progression (AP) that starts with $a$, ends with $b$, and includes the inserted means. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

1. **Determine the Number of Means**: Let $n$ be the number of arithmetic means to insert between $a$ and $b$. This results in $n + 2$ terms (including $a$ and $b$).

2. **Calculate the Common Difference**:
   - The total interval from $a$ to $b$ is $d_{\text{total}} = b - a$.
   - With $n$ means inserted, the number of intervals between terms becomes $(n + 1)$.
   - Therefore, the common difference $d = \frac{b - a}{n + 1}$.

3. **Compute Each Arithmetic Mean**:
   - The first mean $m_1$ is calculated as $m_1 = a + d$.
   - Subsequent means are found by adding multiples of $d$: 
     - $m_2 = m_1 + d$
     - $m_3 = m_2 + d$, and so on, until the last mean is obtained.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose inserting 2 arithmetic means between $a = 4$ and $b = 20$:
     - Number of intervals: $n + 1 = 3$
     - Common difference: $d = \frac{20 - 4}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.333$
     - First mean: $m_1 = 4 + 5.333 \approx 9.333$
     - Second mean: $m_2 = 9.333 + 5.333 \approx 14.666$

This method ensures that the inserted means evenly distribute the interval between $a$ and $b$, producing a smooth progression with equal intervals, which is invaluable in applications requiring uniform transitions or distributions.
