To find the sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms in an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$$

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference $d$.
   - The terms are $a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, \ldots, a_n$.

2. **Summing the Terms:**
   - When you add all the terms together:
     $$S_n = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) + \ldots + (a_1 + (n-1)d)$$

3. **Using Pairing Method:**
   - Pair the first term with the last term, second term with the second last term, etc.
     $$S_n = a_1 + a_n + a_2 + a_{n-1} + \ldots$$- Each pair sums to$ a_1 + a_n $.
   - If there are $n$ terms, you have $\frac{n}{2}$ such pairs (if $n$ is even).

4. **Expressing the Sum:**
   - The sum of all pairs is $\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$.
   
5. **Simplifying:**
   - Thus, the formula becomes:
     $$S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$$

6. **Alternative Expression Using Common Difference:**
   - Since $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, substituting gives:
     $$S_n = \frac{n}{2} [a_1 + (a_1 + (n - 1)d)] = n a_1 + \frac{d n(n - 1)}{2}$$

**Conclusion:**
The formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$ allows you to calculate the sum of the first $n$ terms without knowing each term individually or the common difference. This is because it leverages the symmetry in arithmetic sequences, ensuring that each pair of terms averages out correctly.

\boxed{S_n = \dfrac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)}
