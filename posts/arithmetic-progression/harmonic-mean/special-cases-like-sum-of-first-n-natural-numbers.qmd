To write a detailed response about the relationship between the sum $S$ and the harmonic mean $H$ in an arithmetic progression (AP) starting at 1 with $n$ terms, we start by recalling the formulas for these quantities.

For an AP starting at 1 with common difference 1, the number of terms is $n$. The sum $S$ of the first $n$ terms can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an AP:
$$S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$The harmonic mean$ H $of these$ n $terms is the reciprocal of the average of their reciprocals. The sum of the reciprocals of the first$ n $natural numbers is known as the harmonic series, which approximates to:$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \approx \ln(n) + \gamma$$where$ \gamma $ (Euler-Mascheroni constant) is approximately 0.5772.

Thus, the harmonic mean $H$ can be expressed as:
$$H \approx \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}} \approx \ln(n) + \gamma$$

### Final Answer
The sum $S$ of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic progression starting at 1 is:
$$\boxed{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$$The harmonic mean$ H $is approximately:$$\ln(n) + \gamma$$where$ \gamma \approx 0.5772 $.
