**Finding the Common Difference in an Arithmetic Progression**

To determine the common difference (denoted as $d$) in an arithmetic progression (AP), follow these steps:

1. **Identify Consecutive Terms:**
   - An AP is defined by each term being generated by adding a constant difference to the previous term.
   - Identify two consecutive terms from the given sequence.

2. **Calculate the Common Difference:**
   - Subtract the first term of the pair from the second term.
     $$d = a_2 - a_1$$- This result gives the common difference$ d $.

3. **Verify Consistency:**
   - Ensure that this difference remains consistent across all consecutive terms in the sequence.
   - For example, if the terms are 5, 8, 11, 14,... then:
     $$8 - 5 = 3,\quad 11 - 8 = 3,\quad 14 - 11 = 3$$
     All differences equal 3, confirming the common difference.

**Example:**

Given terms: $7, 2, -3, -10, ...$

- Identify consecutive pairs:
  - First pair: 7 and 2.
    $$d = 2 - 7 = -5$$- Second pair: 2 and -3.$$d = -3 - 2 = -5$$- Third pair: -3 and -10.$$d = -10 - (-3) = -7$$- The common difference$ d $is consistently$ -5 $.

**Conclusion:**

The common difference in an AP can be found by subtracting consecutive terms. If the sequence adheres to the AP definition, this method ensures consistency across all pairs of terms.

Answer: The common difference in the example was calculated as -5 using two different pairs of terms.
