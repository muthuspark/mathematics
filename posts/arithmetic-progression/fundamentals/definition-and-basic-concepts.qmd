**Arithmetic Progression: A Comprehensive Guide**

**Introduction**
An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. This concept is fundamental in mathematics and finds applications in various fields, including banking, physics, and finance.

**Definition**
- An arithmetic progression is defined as a sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ where each term increases or decreases by a fixed amount known as the common difference ($d$).
- The general form of an AP is:
  $$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$
  Where:
  - $a_n$ is the nth term,
  - $a_1$ is the first term,
  - $d$ is the common difference,
  - $n$ is the term number.

**Key Concepts and Tests**

1. **Consistency of Differences:**
   - To verify if a sequence is an AP, check that the difference between consecutive terms remains constant.
   - Example:
     - Sequence: 3, 7, 11, 15,... (Common difference $d = 4$)

2. **Positive and Negative Common Difference:**
   - If $d > 0$, the sequence is increasing.
   - If $d < 0$, the sequence is decreasing.
   - Example:
     - Decreasing sequence: 10, 5, 0, -5,... (Common difference $d = -5$)

3. **Geometric Progression vs Arithmetic Progression:**
   - While both involve a constant change between terms, they differ in how the change is applied.
   - GP uses multiplication, whereas AP uses addition.

**Examples and Applications**

1. **Example 1:**
   - Sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11,... (Common difference $d = 3$)
   - Verification:
     - Differences: 5-2=3, 8-5=3, etc.
   - Conclusion: This is an AP with a common difference of 3.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Sequence: 10, 7, 4, 1,... (Common difference $d = -3$)
   - Verification:
     - Differences: 7-10=-3, 4-7=-3, etc.
   - Conclusion: This is an AP with a common difference of -3.

**Nth Term Formula**
- The formula to find the nth term of an AP:
  $$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$
- Example Calculation:
  - For $a_5$, where $a_1 = 2$and$d = 3$:
    $$a_5 = 2 + (5 - 1) \times 3 = 2 + 12 = 14$$

**Infinite Arithmetic Progression**
- An AP can be infinite, continuing indefinitely, as there is no upper or lower limit imposed.

**Conclusion**
Understanding arithmetic progression is crucial for various applications. It involves a constant difference between terms, allowing predictable calculation of any term using the nth term formula. This concept underpins many mathematical and real-world scenarios where steady growth or decline is observed.
