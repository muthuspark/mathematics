**Understanding Consecutive Terms in Arithmetic Progression**

**Introduction**

Arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. These consecutive terms are one after another without any gaps, forming a linear sequence.

**Key Concepts**

1. **First Term (a):** The initial number in the sequence.
2. **Common Difference (d):** The fixed amount added between each term.
3. **nth Term Formula:** t_n = a + (n-1)d, which gives any term based on its position.

**Consecutive Terms**

Consecutive terms are one after another in an AP, each differing by the common difference 'd'. For example, if you have 2, 5, 8, 11,..., the first term is 2, and each subsequent term increases by 3 (common difference).

**Examples of Consecutive Terms**

- If a = 3 and d = 4:
  - t_1 = 3
  - t_2 = 7
  - t_3 = 11

**Properties or Applications**

Studying consecutive terms in AP is crucial for more advanced math topics like sequences, series, and calculus. Understanding their properties helps in various real-world applications such as compound interest.

**Conclusion**

Consecutive terms in an AP are foundational to arithmetic progression, essential for grasping linear sequences and their applications. This knowledge prepares students for more complex mathematical concepts, making it a vital topic from the fundamentals of arithmetic progression.
