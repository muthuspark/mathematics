Coefficient comparison is a problem-solving strategy used in arithmetic progression (AP) problems by equating coefficients of like terms across expressions derived from AP structures. This method helps form systems of linear equations, allowing solutions for unknown variables through elimination or substitution.

**Steps in Detail:**

1. **Express Terms Using AP Formula**: Each term in an AP can be written as $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.

2. **Set Up Equations**: If given expressions for terms at different positions, set up equations based on their coefficients of variables or constants.

3. **Solve Equations**: Use methods like elimination or substitution to solve the system formed by equating corresponding coefficients.

**Example:**

Given two terms from an AP:
- Term 3: $4n + 5m = 13$
- Term 7: $2n - m = 7$

Set up equations based on corresponding terms and solve for $n$ and $m$.

**Conclusion:**
Coefficient comparison in arithmetic progression involves equating coefficients of like terms from different expressions or APs to form systems that can be solved, aiding in finding unknown variables efficiently.
