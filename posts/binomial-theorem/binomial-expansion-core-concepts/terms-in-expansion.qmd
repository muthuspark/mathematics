To expand a product involving multiple variables, we can systematically consider each factor and determine the number of ways to select variables from them, leading to combinatorial formulas for coefficients.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Expansion Structure:**
   Consider an expression like $(a_1 + b_1)(a_2 + b_2)\ldots(a_n + b_n)$. Each factor contributes either $a_i$or$b_i$.

2. **Determine Coefficients Using Combinations:**
   - For two variables, each term's coefficient is determined by choosing $k$factors to contribute$a_i$, leading to binomial coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$.
   - With more than two variables, each factor contributes multiple variables (e.g., trinomial expansion).

3. **Apply Multinomial Coefficients:**
   - When expanding a product with multiple variables per term, multinomial coefficients come into play.
   - For example, in $(a + b + c)^n$, the coefficient of $a^k b^m c^p$is given by$\frac{n!}{k! m! p!}$where$k + m + p = n$.

4. **Systematic Expansion:**
   - Expand each factor step-by-step, ensuring all combinations are considered.
   - For each term in the expansion, track how variables are selected from each factor.

**Conclusion:**

By systematically considering each factor and applying combinatorial principles (combinations with repetition and multinomial coefficients), we can fully expand products involving multiple variables. This approach ensures that all possible selections of variables are accounted for, leading to a comprehensive expansion.
