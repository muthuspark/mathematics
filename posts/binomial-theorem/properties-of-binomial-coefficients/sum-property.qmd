**Exploring the Sum Property in Binomial Coefficients**

In algebra, binomial coefficients play a crucial role in expanding expressions of the form (a + b)^n using the Binomial Theorem. Each term in such an expansion is given by C(n, k) * a^(n - k) * b^k, where C(n, k) represents the binomial coefficient "n choose k." This coefficient is calculated as n! / [k!(n - k)!], which gives the number of ways to select k elements from a set of n elements.

**Understanding Binomial Coefficients**

Binomial coefficients are essential in various mathematical contexts. For instance, they represent the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, denoted as C(n, k). These coefficients are symmetric, meaning C(n, k) = C(n, n - k), which simplifies expressions and calculations.

**The Sum Property: The Total Sum**

A fundamental property of binomial coefficients is their summation. When we expand (1 + 1)^n using the Binomial Theorem, each term becomes C(n, k) * 1^(n - k) * 1^k, which simplifies to just C(n, k). Adding all these terms from k = 0 to n gives us the sum of binomial coefficients for that particular n.

**Calculating the Sum for Small Values**

To illustrate, let's compute this sum for small values of n:

- For n = 0: (1 + 1)^0 = 1, and C(0, 0) = 1. Thus, the sum is 1.
  
- For n = 1: (1 + 1)^1 = 2, and C(1, 0) + C(1, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

- For n = 2: (1 + 1)^2 = 4, and C(2, 0) + C(2, 1) + C(2, 2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Each time, the sum equals 2^n. This pattern holds true for any non-negative integer n.

**General Proof of the Sum**

Mathematically, (1 + 1)^n expands to:

C(n, 0)*1^n + C(n, 1)*1^(n - 1)*1^1 + ... + C(n, n)*1^0

Simplifying each term as 1, we obtain the sum of all binomial coefficients for that power. This demonstrates that their total equals 2^n.

**Significance and Applications**

This property is not just a mathematical curiosity; it's foundational in many areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, probability, and algebra. Understanding this summation helps in solving complex problems more efficiently by breaking them down into simpler components.

In conclusion, the sum of all binomial coefficients for a given n is 2^n, which is a key insight that underpins numerous mathematical concepts and practical applications.
