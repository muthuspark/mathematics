Let's explore the relationship between **combinations** (nCr) and **permutations** (nPr). Both concepts are fundamental in combinatorics and appear frequently in binomial theorem problems.

### 1. Definitions

- **Permutation**: A permutation is an arrangement of objects where the order matters. The number of permutations of **n** distinct objects taken **r** at a time is given by:
  
  $$P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$
  
  Here, "!" denotes factorial.

- **Combination**: A combination is an arrangement of objects where the order does not matter. The number of combinations of **n** distinct objects taken **r** at a time is given by:
  
  $$C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$$

### 2. Relationship Between Permutations and Combinations

The relationship between permutations and combinations can be expressed as:

$$C(n, r) = \frac{P(n, r)}{r!}$$This formula tells us that the number of combinations is equal to the number of permutations divided by$ r! $.

### 3. Detailed Explanation

#### a. **Understanding Permutations**

When arranging objects where order matters, we use permutations. For example, if you have three books and want to arrange them on a shelf:

- The first book can be any of the 3.
- The second book can be any of the remaining 2.
- The third book has only 1 option left.

So, there are $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$ ways to arrange the books. This is written as $P(3, 3) = 6$.

#### b. **Understanding Combinations**

When arranging objects where order does not matter, we use combinations. For example, if you want to select 2 books out of 3 without worrying about their order on a shelf:

- The first book can be any of the 3.
- The second book has only 2 options left.

But since the order doesn't matter, we've counted each pair twice (e.g., selecting book A and then B is the same as selecting B and then A). Therefore, we divide by $r!$ to account for this duplication. So:

$$C(3, 2) = \frac{P(3, 2)}{2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$

The possible combinations are: {A, B}, {A, C}, and {B, C}.

### 4. Example Problem

Let's apply this relationship to a real problem involving binomial theorem.

**Problem**: Expand $(x + y)^3$ using the binomial theorem.

---

#### a. **Using Permutations**

First, let's find all permutations of 3 items:

$$P(3, 3) = \frac{3!}{(3 - 3)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6$$Each term in the expansion corresponds to a different permutation of$ x $and$ y $. For example:

- $x^3 y^0$
- $x^2 y^1$
- $x^1 y^2$
- $x^0 y^3$

There are 6 terms, which matches the number of permutations.

#### b. **Using Combinations**

Now, let's find all combinations of 3 items taken 2 at a time:

$$C(3, 2) = \frac{P(3, 2)}{2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$

Each combination corresponds to a term in the expansion. For example:

- $x^2 y$
- $x y^1$
- $y^2$

There are 3 terms, which matches the number of combinations.

### 5. Conversion Between Permutations and Combinations

The formula to convert between permutations and combinations is:

$$C(n, r) = \frac{P(n, r)}{r!}$$or equivalently,$$P(n, r) = C(n, r) \times r!$$

This formula allows us to switch between the two concepts.

### 6. Conclusion

Understanding the relationship between combinations and permutations is crucial for solving combinatorial problems, especially in binomial theorem applications. Permutations count arrangements where order matters, while combinations count selections without considering order. The key equation that connects them is:

$$C(n, r) = \frac{P(n, r)}{r!}$$

This relationship helps simplify calculations and reinforces the importance of understanding permutations versus combinations in various mathematical contexts.
