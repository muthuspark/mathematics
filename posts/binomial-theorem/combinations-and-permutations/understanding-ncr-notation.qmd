Here's a clear, step-by-step explanation of how to understand and use combinations in the context of the binomial theorem:

1. **Understanding nCr Notation:**
   - nCr represents "n choose r," which is the number of ways to select r elements from a set of n without considering order.
   - The formula for nCr is:
     $$C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$$
     where "!" denotes factorial.

2. **Expansion in Binomial Theorem:**
   - The binomial theorem allows us to expand expressions of the form (a + b)^n.
   - Each term in the expansion is given by:
     $$C(n, k) \cdot a^{n-k} \cdot b^k$$
     where k ranges from 0 to n.

3. **Example with Combinations:**
   - Consider expanding (a + b)^3.
     - The expansion is:
       $$a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$$
     - Coefficients are C(3,0)=1, C(3,1)=3, C(3,2)=3, and C(3,3)=1.

4. **Connecting to Permutations:**
   - Since nCr counts combinations (without order), it aligns with how terms in the expansion are formed.
   - For each term, we're choosing k factors of b from n total factors, which is why C(n,k) applies.

5. **Another Example:**
   - Expand (x + y)^4:
     $$x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4$$
     Coefficients are C(4,0)=1, C(4,1)=4, C(4,2)=6, C(4,3)=4, and C(4,4)=1.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Each term in the expansion of (a + b)^n uses nCr to determine coefficients.
   - This ties into combinations, counting ways to select items without considering order, aligning with the binomial theorem's combinatorial nature.

Understanding this connects the concepts of combinations and permutations to algebraic expansions, providing a foundational link between probability theory and polynomial expansions.
