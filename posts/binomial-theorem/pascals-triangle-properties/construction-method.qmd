**Construction Method of Pascal's Triangle and Its Properties in the Binomial Theorem**

![](../3a8beb14cd64d7451f9f9e4f965713d3e7e62cbb.svg)

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It begins with 1 at the top (considered as the zeroth row), and each subsequent row starts and ends with 1, with inner numbers formed by adding adjacent numbers from the previous row.

**Step-by-Step Construction:**

1. **Start with the Zeroth Row:** Begin with a single number, 1, which is the zeroth row (Row 0).

2. **Construct Subsequent Rows:**
   - **First Row (Row 1):** Start and end with 1.
   - **Second Row (Row 2):** Add two 1s to get 1 1.
   - **Third Row (Row 3):** Each inner number is the sum of two numbers above it, resulting in 1 2 1.
   - Continue this process for each subsequent row.

3. **Properties Related to the Binomial Theorem:**
   - **Coefficient Matching:** Each entry in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to a binomial coefficient from expansions like $(a + b)^n$. For example, $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ uses coefficients 1, 2, 1 from the second row.
   - **Symmetry:** The triangle is symmetric; each number mirrors its counterpart across the vertical axis. This symmetry helps in simplifying calculations and recognizing patterns.

4. **Sum of Entries:**
   - Each row sums to $2^n$, where n is the row number starting from 0. For example, Row 0 sums to $1 = 2^0$, Row 1 sums to $2 = 2^1$, and so on.

5. **Combinatorial Interpretation:**
   - Each entry in Pascal's Triangle represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, given by $n \choose k$. This connects combinatorial problems with algebraic expansions.

6. **Recursive Property:**
   - Each number is the sum of all numbers above it in the previous rows, leading to patterns like diagonals representing powers of 11 and other sequences.

7. **Applications Beyond Algebra:**
   - Pascal's Triangle is used in probability theory (combining outcomes) and computer science (recursive algorithms).

**Conclusion:**

Pascal's Triangle offers a visual and systematic approach to understanding binomial expansions, offering insights into combinatorics and algebraic patterns. Its recursive construction and symmetric properties make it an invaluable tool across mathematics and beyond.
