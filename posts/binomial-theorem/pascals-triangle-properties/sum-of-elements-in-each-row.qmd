Let's explore how to find the sum of the elements in each row of Pascal's Triangle using properties from the **Binomial Theorem**. 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**
   - Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
   - Each row $n$ corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of $(a + b)^n$.

2. **Binomial Theorem Basics:**
   - The Binomial Theorem states that:
     $$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$$where$ \binom{n}{k} $ is the binomial coefficient, also known as "n choose k."

3. **Identifying the Elements in Each Row:**
   - In Pascal's Triangle:
     - The topmost row (row 0) has a single element: $\binom{0}{0} = 1$.
     - The next row (row 1) has two elements: $\binom{1}{0} = 1$, $\binom{1}{1} = 1$.
     - Subsequent rows continue this pattern, with each entry being the sum of the two entries above it.

4. **Summing the Elements in a Single Row:**
   - To find the sum of all elements in row $n$, we can substitute $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ into the binomial expansion formula:
     $$(1 + 1)^n = 2^n$$- This means that each row$ n $sums up to$ 2^n $.

5. **Example:**
   - Let's verify this with a few rows:
     - **Row 0:** Only element is 1.
       Sum = $1 = 2^0 = 1$.
     - **Row 1:** Elements are 1 and 1.
       Sum = $1 + 1 = 2 = 2^1 = 2$.
     - **Row 2:** Elements are 1, 2, 1.
       Sum = $1 + 2 + 1 = 4 = 2^2 = 4$.
     - **Row 3:** Elements are 1, 3, 3, 1.
       Sum = $1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8 = 2^3 = 8$.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the elements in row $n$ of Pascal's Triangle is always $2^n$.
   - This result follows directly from substituting $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ into the binomial expansion formula, which simplifies to $2^n$.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the elements in each row $n$ of Pascal's Triangle is equal to $2^n$. This result stems from substituting $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ into the Binomial Theorem, which yields:

$$(1 + 1)^n = 2^n$$Therefore, each row sums up to **$ 2^n$**.
