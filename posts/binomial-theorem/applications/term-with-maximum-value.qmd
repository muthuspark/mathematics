To determine the number of ways in which all 5 balls are picked from these 6 boxes, we consider that each pick can be made from any of the 6 boxes. This problem is equivalent to finding the number of sequences where order matters and repetition is allowed.

1. For each pick (there are 5 picks), there are 6 possible choices (boxes).
2. The total number of ways is given by raising the number of choices (6) to the power of the number of picks (5).

Thus, the number of ways is calculated as:
$$6^5 = 7776$$The final answer is:$$\boxed{7776}$$
