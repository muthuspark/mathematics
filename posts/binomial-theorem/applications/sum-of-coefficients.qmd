Let's explore how to use the **Binomial Theorem** to determine the **Sum of Coefficients**. This is a fundamental concept in algebra that simplifies finding coefficients efficiently.

### Understanding the Binomial Expansion
The **Binomial Theorem** is a powerful tool for expanding expressions of the form $(a + b)^n$, where $n$is a non-negative integer. It provides a way to express this expansion as a sum of terms involving powers of$a$and$b$.

Mathematically, the Binomial Theorem states:

$$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot a^{n - k} \cdot b^k$$

Here:
- $C(n, k)$is the **combination** of$n$things taken$k$ at a time, also known as "n choose k."
- The summation runs from $k = 0$to$k = n$.

### Identifying the Coefficients
Each term in the expansion $\sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot a^{n - k} \cdot b^k$has a coefficient. These coefficients are given by$C(n, k)$. For example:
- When $k = 0$, the first term is $C(n, 0) \cdot a^n \cdot b^0 = C(n, 0) \cdot a^n$.
- When $k = 1$, the next term is $C(n, 1) \cdot a^{n - 1} \cdot b^1$.
- And so on, until when $k = n$, the last term is $C(n, n) \cdot a^0 \cdot b^n$.

### Summing All Coefficients
To find the **Sum of Coefficients**, we need to determine the sum of all these individual coefficients. In other words, we want:

$$\text{Sum} = C(n, 0) + C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) + \dots + C(n, n)$$Notice that each term in this summation corresponds directly to the coefficient of the corresponding power of$a$and$b$ in the expansion.

### Applying Substitution
To simplify the problem, we can substitute specific values for $a$and$b$. A common choice is to set both $a = 1$and$b = 1$.

Substituting these values into the Binomial Theorem:

$$(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot 1^{n - k} \cdot 1^k$$Simplifying further:$$2^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k)$$

### Conclusion
By substituting $a = 1$and$b = 1$in the Binomial Theorem, we've effectively created an equation where all coefficients are equal to 1. This allows us to compute their sum directly as:$$\text{Sum of Coefficients} = 2^n$$

### Final Answer

The **Sum of Coefficients** in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$is given by$2^n$. By substituting $a = 1$and$b = 1$, we can easily find this sum without having to compute each term individually.

$$\boxed{\text{Sum} = 2^n}$$
