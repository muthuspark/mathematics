### Detailed Explanation of the Other Roots Formula

When dealing with the nth roots of a complex number, we leverage the concept from De Moivre's theorem. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Expressing z in Polar Form:**
   - Any non-zero complex number $z$ can be written as:
     
$$
     z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
     $$

     where $r$ is the modulus (distance from the origin), and $\theta$ is the argument (angle made with the positive real axis).

2. **Finding the nth Root in Polar Form:**
   - To find an nth root of $z$, denote it as $w$. Expressing $w$ in polar form:
     
$$
     w = R(\cos\phi + i\sin\phi)
     $$

     where $R$ is the modulus and $\phi$ is the argument.

3. **Calculating Modulus of the Root:**
   - Since $w^n = z$, equating moduli:
     
$$
     R^n = r \implies R = r^{1/n}
     $$


4. **Determining the Angle for Each Root:**
   - The angle must satisfy:
     
$$
     n\phi \equiv \theta \pmod{2\pi}
     $$

     Solving for $\phi$:
     
$$
     \phi = \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n} \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1
     $$


5. **Expressing Each Root:**
   - The nth roots are:
     
$$
     w_k = r^{1/n}\left[\cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n}\right)\right] \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1
     $$


6. **Conclusion:**
   - Each root $w_k$ has the same modulus $r^{1/n}$ and distinct arguments spaced evenly around the circle at angles $\frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n}$. This ensures all nth roots of $z$ are found, forming an n-sided polygon on the complex plane.

This method simplifies root finding by focusing on modulus and angle in polar coordinates, extending real number roots into a two-dimensional solution set.
