**Exploring Principal Roots in Complex Numbers**

In the realm of complex numbers, understanding roots is crucial. A complex number has both real and imaginary parts, and its square or higher roots can be found using various methods. This article delves into the principal root within the context of complex numbers.

### 1. **Expressing a Complex Number in Polar Form**
Any non-zero complex number $w$ can be expressed in polar form as:

$$ w = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) $$

where:
- $r$ is the modulus (absolute value) of $w$.
- $\theta$ is the argument of $w$, representing its angle from the positive real axis.

### 2. **Finding nth Roots in Polar Form**
To find the nth roots of a complex number, we use De Moivre's theorem:

$$ z_k = r^{1/n} \left( \cos \left( \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n} \right) \right) $$

for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$.

Each root corresponds to a specific value of $k$, resulting in equally spaced angles around the circle with radius $r^{1/n}$.

### 3. **Defining the Principal Root**
The principal root is typically defined by its argument within a specific range:
- **In polar form:** The principal root has an argument between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$.
- **In general terms:** It is the root with the smallest positive angle when considering all possible roots.

### 4. **Examples Illustrating the Concept**
**Example 1: Finding Square Roots of 1**
For $w = 1$:
- Polar form: $1 = 1 (\cos 0 + i \sin 0)$.
- The square roots are:

$$ z_0 = \sqrt{1} \left( \cos \left( \frac{0 + 2\pi \cdot 0}{2} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{0 + 2\pi \cdot 0}{2} \right) \right) = 1 $$


$$ z_1 = \sqrt{1} \left( \cos \left( \frac{0 + 2\pi \cdot 1}{2} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{0 + 2\pi \cdot 1}{2} \right) \right) = -1 $$

- Principal roots: $z_0 = 1$, $z_1 = -1$.

**Example 2: Finding Cube Roots of 1**
For $w = 1$:
- Polar form: $1 = 1 (\cos 0 + i \sin 0)$.
- The cube roots are:

$$ z_k = 1^{1/3} \left( \cos \left( \frac{0 + 2\pi k}{3} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{0 + 2\pi k}{3} \right) \right) $$

for $k = 0, 1, 2$.

The principal root is the one with the smallest positive angle, typically selected based on conventions.

### Conclusion
Understanding the principal root in complex numbers involves expressing roots equally spaced around a circle and selecting the one within a defined argument range. This method provides a systematic approach to finding all nth roots of a complex number.

**Final Answer**
The process for finding each nth root is given by:

$$ z_k = r^{1/n} \left( \cos \left( \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n} \right) \right) $$

for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$, where the principal root is typically defined by its argument within a specific range.
