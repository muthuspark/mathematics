Sure! Let's break down the concept of finding the modulus of a complex number using the formula |a + bi| = √(a² + b²). 

### What is a Complex Number?
A complex number is generally written in the form **z = a + bi**, where:
- $a$ is the real part.
- $b$ is the imaginary part.
- $i$ is the square root of -1, so $i^2 = -1$.

### What is Modulus?
The modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number **z** represents its distance from the origin in the complex plane. The complex plane is like a coordinate system where:
- The **real part** corresponds to the x-axis.
- The **imaginary part** corresponds to the y-axis.

### Geometric Interpretation
In the complex plane, if you plot the complex number **z = a + bi**, it will be represented as the point (a, b). The modulus of **z**, denoted |z|, is the distance from this point (a, b) to the origin (0, 0).

To find this distance using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$


Therefore, 

$$ |z| = |a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$


### Example
Let's compute the modulus of **z = 3 - 4i**.

1. Identify $a$ and $b$:
   - $a = 3$
   - $b = -4$

2. Plug into the formula:
   
$$ |z| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $$


So, **|3 - 4i| = 5**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**
   - Start with a complex number in the form $z = a + bi$.
   - Extract the real part ($a$) and the imaginary part ($b$).

2. **Square Both the Real and Imaginary Parts:**
   - Square the real part: $a^2$
   - Square the imaginary part: $b^2$

3. **Sum the Squares:**
   - Add the squared parts together: $a^2 + b^2$

4. **Take the Square Root of the Sum:**
   - Compute the square root of the sum to get the modulus:
     
$$ |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$


### Summary
The modulus or absolute value of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by:

$$ |z| = |a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$

This formula calculates the distance from the origin to the point (a, b) in the complex plane, which geometrically represents the modulus.
