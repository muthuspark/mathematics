To compute the power of a complex number using De Moivre's theorem, we can follow these steps:

1. Express the complex number $z$ in polar form: $z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$, where $r$ is the modulus and $\theta$ is the argument of the complex number.
2. For a given integer $n$, De Moivre's theorem states that:
   
$$
   z^n = [r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)]^n = r^n (\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta))
   $$

3. This theorem allows us to compute the power of a complex number by separately raising the modulus $r$ to the power $n$ and adding the angles after multiplying them by $n$.

Thus, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{z^n = r^n (\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))}
$$
