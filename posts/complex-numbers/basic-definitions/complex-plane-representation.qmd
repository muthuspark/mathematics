Certainly! Below is an organized, step-by-step explanation of the complex plane representation.

### 1. **Definition of Complex Numbers**

A complex number is defined as an ordered pair $z = a + bi$, where:
- $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.
- $i$ is the imaginary unit satisfying $i^2 = -1$.

This representation combines a real part ($a$) and an imaginary part ($b$).

### 2. **Geometric Representation on the Complex Plane**

Each complex number $z = a + bi$ can be represented as a point $(a, b)$ in a two-dimensional plane:
- The horizontal axis is called the **real axis**.
- The vertical axis is called the **imaginary axis**.

This plane is known as the **complex plane** or **Argand diagram**. Every point on this plane corresponds to a unique complex number and vice versa.

### 3. **Operations in the Complex Plane**

#### **Addition**
To add two complex numbers, you add their corresponding real and imaginary parts:

$$ (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i $$

Geometrically, this is equivalent to vector addition: the resulting vector is obtained by placing the tail of one vector at the tip of the other and drawing a parallelogram.

#### **Multiplication**
Multiplying complex numbers has a geometric interpretation:
- **Rotation**: Multiplying by $i$ corresponds to a rotation of 90 degrees counterclockwise around the origin.
- **Scaling**: Multiplication by real numbers scales the complex number's magnitude while keeping it at the same angle.

For example, multiplying $z = 1 + i$ by $i$:

$$ (1 + i) \cdot i = i + i^2 = i - 1 $$

This corresponds to a rotation of 90 degrees in the plane.

### 4. **Modulus or Absolute Value**

The modulus or absolute value of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is its distance from the origin on the plane:

$$ |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$

This connects back to the Pythagorean theorem, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a right triangle.

### Conclusion

The complex plane provides a geometric interpretation of complex numbers, allowing for intuitive visualization of operations like addition, multiplication, and transformations. This representation is fundamental in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering.
