**Understanding the Equation r = |z| = √(a² + b²) in Polar Form**

1. **Introduction to Complex Numbers:**
   - A complex number z can be represented as z = a + ib, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

2. **Modulus of a Complex Number:**
   - The modulus |z| represents the distance from the origin in the complex plane.
   - It is calculated using the formula:
     
$$ |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$


3. **Expressing z in Polar Form:**
   - In polar form, a complex number can also be written as:
     
$$ z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) $$

   - Here, r is the modulus (distance from the origin), and θ is the argument.

4. **Equivalence Between Polar and Rectangular Forms:**
   - Substitute a and b in terms of r and θ:
     
$$ a = r\cos\theta $$

     
$$ b = r\sin\theta $$

   - Squaring both a and b and adding them gives:
     
$$ a^2 + b^2 = (r\cos\theta)^2 + (r\sin\theta)^2 = r^2(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) = r^2 $$

   - Taking the square root yields:
     
$$ |z| = r $$


5. **Conclusion:**
   - The equation r = |z| is valid because both representations agree on the modulus, which is the radius in polar form and also calculated as √(a² + b²) in rectangular form.

This relationship is fundamental for converting between different forms of complex numbers, facilitating operations like multiplication and division.
