**Addition of Complex Numbers: A Comprehensive Explanation**

In mathematics, complex numbers extend the concept of real numbers by introducing an imaginary component. A complex number is typically expressed as $a + bi$, where:
- $a$ is the real part,
- $b$ is the coefficient of the imaginary unit $i$,
- and $i^2 = -1$.

When adding two complex numbers, such as $(a + bi) + (c + di)$, the process involves combining their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. This rule stems from the structure of complex numbers and ensures consistency with other number systems.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Components**: Break down each complex number into its real and imaginary components.
   - First number: $a$ (real part), $b$ (coefficient for $i$)
   - Second number: $c$ (real part), $d$ (coefficient for $i$)

2. **Add Real Parts**: Sum the real parts of both numbers.
   - Result: $a + c$

3. **Add Imaginary Coefficients**: Sum the coefficients of the imaginary units ($b$ and $d$).
   - Result: $b + d$

4. **Combine Results**: Form a new complex number with the summed real part and the summed imaginary coefficient.
   - Final result: $(a + c) + (b + d)i$

**Why This Rule Works:**

- **Structure of Complex Numbers**: Complex numbers follow specific rules akin to vectors in 2D space. Adding vectors involves component-wise addition, which is consistent with complex number addition.
  
- **Generalization**: This rule generalizes operations from real numbers and integers, where the imaginary part is implicitly zero.

**Applications:**

- **Electrical Engineering**: Used in calculating total impedance in AC circuits by summing resistances (real parts) and reactances (imaginary parts).
- **Physics**: In wave equations or when dealing with vectors, complex numbers provide a natural framework for combining orthogonal components.

In conclusion, the rule $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$ ensures consistency across mathematical systems and real-world applications by treating real and imaginary parts separately. This approach simplifies operations and broadens applicability in various fields.
