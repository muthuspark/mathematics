Let's break down the proof step by step.

**Understand the Functions Involved**

We are dealing with two main inverse trigonometric functions:
1. **Inverse Tangent (tan⁻¹)**: This function returns an angle whose tangent is a given number.
2. **Tangent (tan)**: This function takes an angle and gives the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle.

**Define the Relationship**

Let’s consider an angle θ such that:

$$\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)$$By definition, this means:$$\tan(\theta) = x$$

**Apply Tangent to Both Sides**

Now, we take the tangent of both sides of the equation:

$$\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \tan(x)$$However, notice that on the right side, we have an angle θ inside the tangent function. But since tan(θ) = x, applying tangent to both sides gives:$$\tan(\theta) = x$$But from step 2, we also know that:$$\tan(\theta) = x$$So, substituting back:$$\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x$$

**Conclusion**

Therefore, applying the inverse tangent function to x and then taking the tangent of the result cancels out these operations, leaving us with:

$$\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x$$

This holds true for all real numbers x. 

**Final Answer:**
$$\boxed{\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x}$$
