**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof**

Let's prove that $\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = x$for all$x$in the interval$[-1, 1]$.

1. **Define the Inverse Sine Function:**
   
   Let $y = \sin^{-1}(x)$. By definition of the inverse sine function:
   
   $$\sin(y) = x$$
   
2. **Apply Sine to Both Sides:**
   
   Take the sine of both sides of the equation:
   
   $$\sin(\sin(y)) = \sin(x)$$
   
3. **Simplify Using Trigonometric Identity:**
   
   Since $y = \sin^{-1}(x)$, substituting back into the equation gives:
   
   $$\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = x$$
   
4. **Conclusion:**
   
   Therefore, we have shown that for any $x$in the domain of$\sin^{-1}$, which is $[-1, 1]$:
   
   $$\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = x$$**Final Result:**$\boxed{\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = x}$for all$x$such that$-1 \leq x \leq 1$.
