The identity cot⁻¹(x) = cot⁻¹(x) holds true because both expressions represent the inverse cotangent function. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Cotangent Inverse (cot⁻¹):**
   - The function y = cot⁻¹(x) is defined as finding an angle θ such that cot(θ) = x.
   - The domain of cot⁻¹(x) excludes values where cot(θ) is undefined, which occurs when cos(θ) = 0 (at odd multiples of π/2).

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - Both sides of the equation y = cot⁻¹(x) and z = cot⁻¹(z) are expressions that find angles whose cotangent equals x or z, respectively.

3. **Equality by Definition:**
   - Since both expressions are defining the same inverse operation (finding an angle with a specified cotangent), they must be equal.
   - Therefore, y = z for any valid x and z in their respective domains.

**Conclusion:**  
Both sides of the equation represent the same function—cot⁻¹(x)—which is by definition the inverse of the cotangent function. Hence, cot⁻¹(x) = cot⁻¹(x) holds true as they are fundamentally identical expressions.
