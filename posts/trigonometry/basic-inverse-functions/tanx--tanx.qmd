**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

Let's consider the expression $\tan^{-1}(x)$, which represents the inverse tangent function. We aim to prove that:

$$\tan^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)$$

**Understanding Inverse Functions**

The notation $\tan^{-1}(x)$denotes the inverse tangent function, also known as arctangent. Specifically, if we have a value$y$such that:$$y = \tan(y')$$then:$$y' = \tan^{-1}(y)$$

This means that applying the tangent function to its inverse yields the original input.

**Substituting the Definition**

Let’s denote:

$$\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)$$By definition of the inverse tangent, this implies:$$\tan(\theta) = x$$

**Applying Tangent to Both Sides**

Substitute $\theta$back into the original expression. Taking the tangent of both sides:$$\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \tan(\theta)$$From Step 2, we know that$\tan(\theta) = x$. Therefore:

$$\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x$$

**Simplifying the Left Side**

The left side of the equation simplifies using the property of inverse functions. Specifically:

$$\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x$$This means that applying the tangent function to its own inverse simply returns the original input$x$.

**Conclusion**

From Step 3 and Step 4, we have shown that both sides of the equation $\tan^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)$simplify to$x$. Therefore:

$$\tan^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(x)$$

This completes the proof.

**Final Statement:**

By substituting and simplifying, we’ve proven that the inverse tangent of any real number $x$ is equal to itself. This fundamental property underpins many trigonometric identities and simplifications in calculus and other mathematical fields.
