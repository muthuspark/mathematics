Let's explore this concept step by step.

**Understanding Inverse Secant Function**

The inverse secant function, denoted as $\sec^{-1}(x)$, is defined as follows:

For a real number $x$, 
$$\sec^{-1}(x) = y$$means that:$$\sec(y) = x$$where$ y $lies in the range$ [0, \pi] $(excluding$ \pi/2 $).

**Equality of Inverse Secant Functions**

Consider the equation:

$$\sec^{-1}(x) = \sec^{-1}(x)$$Both sides of this equation are identical. The left side is$ \sec^{-1}(x) $, and the right side is also $\sec^{-1}(x)$. Since they refer to the same function, their equality is inherently true.

**Conclusion**

The equation $\sec^{-1}(x) = \sec^{-1}(x)$ holds true for all valid inputs $x$, as both sides represent the same inverse secant function evaluated at the same argument. Therefore, it is an identity that is always satisfied within the domain of $\sec^{-1}$.

$$\boxed{ \sec^{-1}(x) = \sec^{-1}(x) }$$
