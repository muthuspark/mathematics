**Proof:**

We start by recalling the definition of the **secant function**, which is one of the trigonometric functions. The secant of an angle θ (written as $\sec{\theta}$) is defined as the reciprocal of the cosine of the same angle:

$$\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$$

**Understanding the Definition**

From the definition, we see that:

$$\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$$
This equation expresses the relationship between the secant and cosine functions. 

**Solving for $\cos{\theta}$**

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\cos{\theta}$:

$$\cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sec{\theta}}$$This shows that:$$\cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sec{\theta}}$$

**Conclusion for the First Identity**

Thus, we have proven that:

$$\cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sec{\theta}}$$

**Second Identity: $\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$**

This identity directly follows from the definition of secant. As shown in Step 1, by definition:

$$\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$$
Therefore, this identity is true by definition.

**Final Conclusion:**

Both identities are proven as follows:

1. **Starting with the definition of secant:**
   $$\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$$

2. **Solving for cosine:**$$\cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sec{\theta}}$$

Thus, both equations are true by definition.
