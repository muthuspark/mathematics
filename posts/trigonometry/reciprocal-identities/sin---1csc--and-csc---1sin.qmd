To prove $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}$ using the triangle's angles and sides, we'll consider a right-angled triangle. Here's the step-by-step proof:

**Labeling a right-angled triangle**

In a right-angled triangle, let:

- $\theta$ be one of the acute angles.
- The **opposite side** to angle $\theta$ is labeled as $a$.
- The **adjacent side** to angle $\theta$ is labeled as $b$.
- The **hypotenuse** is labeled as $c$.

**Definition of sine in terms of the triangle**

In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle $\theta$ is defined as:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{a}{c}
$$


**Definition of cosecant in terms of the triangle**

The cosecant of angle $\theta$ is the reciprocal of sine, defined as:

$$
\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}} = \frac{c}{a}
$$


**Reciprocal of cosecant**

Now, take the reciprocal of $\csc \theta$:

$$
\frac{1}{\csc \theta} = \frac{a}{c}
$$


**Compare with $\sin \theta$**

From Step 2, we know:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{a}{c}
$$


Thus, we have:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}
$$


This proves that $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}$ using the triangle's angles and sides.
