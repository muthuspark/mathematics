**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof**

We aim to prove that:

$$\sin A \cdot \sin B = \frac{\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)}{2}$$

This is a standard trigonometric identity derived from sum-to-product identities. Let's break down the proof step by step.

**Recall Sum-to-Product Identities**

The sum-to-product identities relate sums or differences of sines and cosines to products:

1. **Sum of Sines:**
   $$\sin A + \sin B = 2\sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)$$2. **Difference of Sines:**$$\sin A - \sin B = 2\cos\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)$$3. **Sum of Cosines:**$$\cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)$$4. **Difference of Cosines:**$$\cos A - \cos B = -2\sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)$$

**Derive the Expression for sin A sin B Using Sum-to-Product Identities**

We can express sin A and sin B using sum-to-product identities. However, a more straightforward approach is to use a different identity.

Recall that:

$$\cos(A - B) + \cos(A + B) = 2\cos A \cos B$$$$ \cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B) = 2\sin A \sin B$$

**Derive sin A sin B**

Let's derive the expression for sin A sin B using the second identity:

Starting with:

$$\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B) = 2\sin A \sin B$$Divide both sides by 2 to solve for sin A sin B:$$\sin A \cdot \sin B = \frac{\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)}{2}$$

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, we have proven that:

$$\sin A \cdot \sin B = \frac{\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)}{2}$$

This identity is often used in various areas of mathematics and physics to simplify expressions involving products of sine functions.
