To prove that $\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}$, we can use the sine and cosine addition formulas.

**Recall the Sine Addition Formula**

The formula for the sine of a sum is:

$$\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B$$

**Recall the Cosine Addition Formula**

The formula for the cosine of a sum is:

$$\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$$

**Express Tangent as a Ratio of Sine to Cosine**

Tangent can be written as:

$$\tan(X) = \frac{\sin X}{\cos X}$$Applying this to$A + B$:

$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin(A + B)}{\cos(A + B)}$$

**Substitute the Sine and Cosine Formulas**

Substitute the expressions for sine and cosine from Step 1 and Step 2 into the tangent formula:

$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B}$$**Divide Numerator and Denominator by$\cos A \cos B$**

To simplify, divide both the numerator and denominator by $\cos A \cos B$:

$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\left( \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} \right) + \left( \frac{\sin B}{\cos B} \right)}{1 - \left( \frac{\sin A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B} \right)}$$

**Recognize Tangent as Sine Over Cosine**

Notice that:

$$\frac{\sin X}{\cos X} = \tan X$$Thus, substitute back into the equation:$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}$$This completes the proof of the tangent addition formula. The derivation works for any angles$A$and$B$, as the identities hold true regardless of their values, provided they are within the domain where cosine is not zero.

**Verification with Negative Angles:**

If we consider negative angles, say $-B$, then:

$$\tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A + (-\tan B)}{1 - \tan A (-\tan B)} = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}$$
Which aligns with the known formula for tangent of a difference.

Thus, the addition formula holds for both positive and negative angles.
