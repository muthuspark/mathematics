 Let's provide a step-by-step proof for the identity $\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$.

**Recall the Angle Addition Formula**

The sine of the sum of two angles can be expressed using the following formula:

$$\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B$$

This formula allows us to expand the sine of a sum into simpler terms involving sines and cosines of individual angles.

**Apply the Formula to $\sin(2\theta)$**

Notice that $2\theta = \theta + \theta$. Therefore, we can apply the angle addition formula by setting both angles $A$ and $B$ equal to $\theta$:

$$\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin \theta \cos \theta + \cos \theta \sin \theta$$

**Simplify the Expression**

Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

$$\sin(2\theta) = \sin \theta \cos \theta + \cos \theta \sin \theta$$Combine like terms ($\sin \theta \cos \theta$ and$\cos \theta \sin \theta$are identical):$$\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta$$

**Conclusion**

Thus, we have proven that:

$$\boxed{\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}$$
