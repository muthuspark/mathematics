Let's provide a clear and step-by-step proof for the identity $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$.

**Recall the Definition of Cosecant**

The cosecant function is defined as the reciprocal of the sine function:

$$\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$$

**Understand the Property of Sine for Negative Angles**

One key property of trigonometric functions, particularly the sine function, is that it is an **odd function**. This means that:

$$\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$$
In other words, when you input a negative angle into the sine function, it outputs the negative of what it would have outputted for the positive angle.

**Apply the Sine Function to Negative Angle**

Using the property from Step 2:

$$\csc(-\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(-\theta)} = \frac{1}{-\sin(\theta)}$$

**Simplify the Expression**

Simplify the denominator by factoring out a negative sign:

$$\csc(-\theta) = \frac{-1}{\sin(\theta)}$$

**Express as Negative Cosecant Function**

Recognize that $-\frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$ is equivalent to $-\csc(\theta)$:

$$\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$$

**Conclusion**

By using the definition of cosecant and the property of sine being an odd function, we have shown that:

$$\boxed{\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)}$$
