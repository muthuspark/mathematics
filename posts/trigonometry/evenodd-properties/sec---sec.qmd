To determine why cosine is an even function, we start by considering the unit circle concept where each angle corresponds to a point (x, y) on the circle with radius 1. The x-coordinate of this point is defined as cosine: $\cos(\theta) = x$. Similarly, the y-coordinate is sine: $\sin(\theta) = y$.

For an angle $-\theta$, its coordinates are $(\cos(-\theta), \sin(-\theta))$ due to reflection properties on the unit circle. Since cosine depends only on the x-coordinate and both points for $\theta$ and $-\theta$ have the same x-coordinate (because reflecting over the x-axis does not change the x-coordinate), it follows that $\cos(\theta) = \cos(-\theta)$.

Therefore, cosine is an even function because its value does not change when reflecting across the y-axis, corresponding to negating the angle $\theta$ or $-\theta$. Thus, we have:

$$\boxed{\cos(-x) = \cos(x)}$$
