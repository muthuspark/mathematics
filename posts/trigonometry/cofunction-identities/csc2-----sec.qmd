To prove that $\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sec\theta$, we can proceed step by step as follows:

**Understand the Definitions**

- **Cosecant (csc)** is defined as the reciprocal of sine:
  
  $$\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}$$- **Secant (sec)** is defined as the reciprocal of cosine:$$\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}$$

**Apply the Cosecant Function to the Angle**

We start with:

$$\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)$$Using the definition of cosecant, this becomes:$$\frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)}$$

**Use the Co-Function Identity for Sine**

Recall that:

$$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos\theta$$Substituting this into our expression:$$\frac{1}{\cos\theta}$$

**Relate to Secant**

From the definition of secant, we have:

$$\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}$$Thus:$$\frac{1}{\cos\theta} = \sec\theta$$

**Conclusion**

Combining all the steps, we conclude that:

$$\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sec\theta$$

This identity holds true by utilizing the co-function relationships between sine and cosine.
