To prove that $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sin(\theta)$, we'll explore this using several approaches, including trigonometric identities and a unit circle perspective.

**Understanding the Relationship Between Cosine and Sine**

Trigonometric functions have reciprocal relationships. Specifically, sine and cosine are co-functions. This means that:

$$\sin(\theta) = \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right)$$and$$\cos(\theta) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right)$$

This relationship is derived from the fact that sine and cosine are cofunctions, meaning they are supplementary functions.

**Using a Unit Circle Approach**

Let's visualize this using the unit circle. Consider an angle $\theta$ on the unit circle. The coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle are:

$$(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$$Now, consider the reference angle$ \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta $. This is a rotation that complements $\theta$ to form a right angle ($\frac{\pi}{2}$).

- The point corresponding to $\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta$ will have coordinates:

$$(\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right), \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right))$$Since these are cofunctions, the sine and cosine of$ \theta $correspond to each other in this complementary angle:$$\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \sin(\theta)$$
$$\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos(\theta)$$

**Verifying with Specific Angles**

Let's test this identity with specific angle values:

1. **Case 1:** $\theta = 0^\circ$

   $$\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 0 \right) = \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 0$$$$\sin(0^\circ) = 0$$Both sides equal$ 0 $.

2. **Case 2:** $\theta = 30^\circ$

   $$\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 30^\circ \right) = \cos\left( 60^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{2}$$$$\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$$Both sides equal$ \frac{1}{2} $.

3. **Case 3:** $\theta = 45^\circ$

   $$\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 45^\circ \right) = \cos\left( 45^\circ \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$$$\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$Both sides equal$ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $.

**Conclusion**

Through the co-function relationship, unit circle visualization, and verification with specific angles, we have shown that:

$$\boxed{ \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \sin(\theta) }$$
