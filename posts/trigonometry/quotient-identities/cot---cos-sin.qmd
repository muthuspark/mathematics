To prove that $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$, let's follow these easy-to-understand steps:

**Understand the Definition of Cotangent**

Cotangent, often written as $\cot \theta$, is one of the reciprocal trigonometric functions. It is defined as:

$$\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}$$

**Recall the Definition of Tangent**

Tangent ($\tan \theta$) is another trigonometric function and is also known to be the ratio of cosine ($\cos \theta$) to sine ($\sin \theta$). Specifically:

$$\tan \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$$

**Substitute Tangent into Cotangent**

Since cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, we substitute the expression for $\tan \theta$from Step 2 into the equation for$\cot \theta$:

$$\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \right)}$$

**Simplify the Reciprocal of a Fraction**

Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, we can simplify:

$$\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \right)} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$$

**Conclusion:**

After substituting and simplifying, we have shown that:

$$\cot \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$$This completes the proof that$\cot \theta$is equal to$\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$.
