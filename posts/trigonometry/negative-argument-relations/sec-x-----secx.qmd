Let's prove the formula step by step.

**Given:**  
We want to show that:

$$\sec^{-1}(-x) = \pi - \sec^{-1}(x)$$

**Understanding Inverse Secant**

Recall that for a function $f$, its inverse function $f^{-1}$ is defined such that:

$$f(a) = b \quad \text{if and only if} \quad f^{-1}(b) = a$$Applying this to the secant function:$$\sec(\theta) = x \quad \text{means} \quad \sec^{-1}(x) = \theta$$Similarly,$$\sec(\phi) = -x \quad \text{means} \quad \sec^{-1}(-x) = \phi$$**Relating$ \theta $and$ \phi $**

From Step 1, we have:

$$\theta = \sec^{-1}(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \phi = \sec^{-1}(-x)$$This implies:$$\sec(\theta) = x \quad \text{and} \quad \sec(\phi) = -x$$**Expressing$ \cos(\theta) $and$ \cos(\phi) $**

Using the definition of secant, which is reciprocal cosine:

$$\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} \quad \text{and} \quad \sec(\phi) = \frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}$$So,$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\phi) = -\frac{1}{x}$$

**Analyzing the Quadrants**

- Since $\sec(\theta) = x$, which is positive, $\theta$ must lie in either the **first quadrant** or the **fourth quadrant**, where cosine is positive.
  
- Similarly, since $\sec(\phi) = -x$, which is negative, $\phi$ must lie in either the **second quadrant** or the **third quadrant**, where cosine is negative.

**Relating Angles**

Notice that:

$$\cos(\phi) = -\frac{1}{x} = -\sec(\theta)$$This implies that$ \phi $is an angle whose cosine is the negative of the cosine of$ \theta $.

Given the quadrants identified earlier, we can see that:

$$\phi = \pi - \theta$$

**Concluding the Proof**

Therefore,
$$\sec^{-1}(-x) = \phi = \pi - \theta = \pi - \sec^{-1}(x)$$
This completes the proof.

**Final Answer:**
$$\boxed{\sec^{-1}(-x) = \pi - \sec^{-1}(x)}$$
